# compare-file-sizes
This script will prompt your for 2 folders, and return a list of file paths that have the exact same (to the byte) file size.
The script goes through and compares the size of a file from the first directory with the size of every other file from the second directory.

The list is formatted into two columns (folder 1, the first selected, and folder 2, the second selected). These are separated by tabs to permit easy pasting into a spreadsheet for further manipulation.

Note: The script will overwrite previous lists that have been created.
